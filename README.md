### This one's particularly agonizing. I gave up.

#### Build & Run
Linux:
```
make run
```
Windows:
```
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
```
ok for real:
```
gcc *.c array/*.c doubly_linked_list/*.c single_linked_list/*.c -o main.exe && ./main.exe
```
WARNING: You may encounter something similar to `Can't recognize 'clear' as an internal or external command, or batch script.` among other things because Windows sucks and I will not bother to test and/or support it as long as it compiles and runs with no errors on my system.
